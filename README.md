Graph Color,
I put this together in Visual Studio for easy acess to Boost, so you might need that to open it.
Was thinking of going the same way as knap stack

1. take the nodes: ex. 4 and num of colors: ex. 3
2. set colors: 0000
3. check conflicts: if shared edge and color conflcit +1
4. Progress through: 0001 ... 0002, however this progress cant be just binary it'll be to a limit to the num of colors
ex. 0000 0001 0002 0010 0011 0012 0020 0021 0022 0100 0101 0102 0110
